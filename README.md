# `HeadGait` - Deep and Machine Learning Models for Initial Contacts Detection and Gait Speed Estimation with a Head-Worn Inertial Measurement Unit

Welcome to the `HeadGait` repository! This repository contains a basic example of a Matlab-Python application for the detection of initial contacts and the estimation of gait speed from acceleration and angular velocity data recorded by a Head-worn Inertial Measurement Unit (H-IMU). Raw data is preprocessed in Matlab, then initial contacts are detected by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) trained with over 100.000 gait cyles in both structured and real-world conditions. Finally, gait speed is inferred by a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model fed with nine time-domain features extracted from the previously segmented gait cycles. 

The study design and the procedures for data collection, model training, optimization and evaluation are described in <a href="#1">[1]</a>

This project is based on [my-gait-events-tcn](https://github.com/rmndrs89/my-gait-events-tcn.git). The code for training (not included in the current project) and evaluating the model was adapted from the referenced repository.

## Overview

The provided application is ready-to-run, requiring minimal setup. The process involves three main steps:

1. **Matlab Pre-processing:**
   - Run the `preprocessing.m` script in Matlab to perform pre-processing on example raw data.
   - This step prepares the data for input into the Temporal Convolutional Network.

2. **Initial Contacts Detection:**
   - After pre-processing, run the Python script `example_initial_contacts_detection.py` to make the TCN infer initial contacts.
   - The relevant Python script is provided for seamless integration with the processed data.

3. **Gait Speed Estimation:**
   - Onc detected initial contacts, run the Matlab script `example_gait_speed_estimation.m` to make the GPR model infer gait speed.
   - The relevant Python script is provided for seamless integration with the processed data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:

- **Matlab:** MATLAB R2022a or later.
- **Python:** Python 3.12, with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage (Windows)

Clone the repository to your local machine :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-MOVE-LAB/headgait.git
```

Then, create a virtual environment with the required modules (example: `venv_headgait`) : 

```bash
python -m venv venv_headgait
venv_headgait\Scripts\activate     
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, everything is set for you to start and play around!

1. **Matlab Pre-processing:**
   - Open the `preprocessing.m` script in Matlab. Be sure that `headgait\` is the current folder.
   - Run the script to perform pre-processing on the example raw data. This include filtering, scaling and windowing.
   - Verify that pre-processed data is correctly saved in location `example_data\preprocessed\data.mat`.
   
2. **Python Inference:**
   - Open `icd_head_app\` as a project in your IDE (suggested: PyCharm).
   - Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment.
   - Run the script to make inference on the pre-processed data and measure detection performance.
