# `icd_head_app`: Initial Contacts Detection Using Temporal Convolutional Networks and a Head-Worn IMU

Welcome to the `icd_head_app` repository! This repository contains a basic example of a Python application for the estimation of initial contacts from acceleration and angular velocity data recorded by a Head Inertial Measurement Unit (H-IMU). Raw data is preprocessed in Matlab, while inference is performed in Python by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) trained with over 100.000 gait cyles in both structured and real-world conditions!

This project is based on [my-gait-events-tcn](https://github.com/rmndrs89/my-gait-events-tcn.git). The code for training (not included in the current project) and evaluating the model was adapted from the referenced repository.

## Overview

The provided application is ready-to-run, requiring minimal setup. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Matlab Pre-processing:**
   - Run the `preprocessing.m` script in Matlab to perform pre-processing on example raw data.
   - This step prepares the data for input into the Temporal Convolutional Network.

2. **Python Inference:**
   - After pre-processing, run the Python script to make the TCN infer initial contacts.
   - The relevant Python script is provided for seamless integration with the processed data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the application:

- **Matlab:** MATLAB R2022a or later.
- **Python:** Python 3.12, with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage (Windows)

Clone the repository to your local machine :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-MOVE-LAB/icd_head_app.git
```

Then, set the `venv_icd_head` folder as the virtual environment for the project : 

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_icd_head
venv_icd_head\Scripts\activate

```

And install the required packages :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, everything is set for you to start and play around!

1. **Matlab Pre-processing:**
   - Open the `preprocessing.m` script in Matlab. Be sure that `icd_head_app\` is the current folder.
   - Run the script to perform pre-processing on the example raw data. This include filtering, scaling and windowing.
   - Verify that pre-processed data is correctly saved in location `example_data\preprocessed\data.mat`.
   
2. **Python Inference:**
   - Open `icd_head_app\` as a project in your IDE (suggested: PyCharm).
   - Open the `main.py` script in a Python environment.
   - Run the script to make inference on the pre-processed data and measure detection performance.

## Example Data

Example raw data is provided in the `example_data` directory. Use this data to familiarize yourself with the application's workflow and as a reference for running the pre-processing and inference scripts. The full dataset [TO-Walk](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/z3g5-nk54) is available on IEEE DataPort.
